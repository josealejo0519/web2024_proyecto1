                <p>Getting food to your fridge is a full-time job in Venezuela,‚Äù she told me, wiping sweat from her
                    forehead.
                    It was 9:30 a.m., and already she had been standing under the blazing September sun for three hours.
                    She said she often spends three full days a week waiting in line to buy basic products.
                    ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not like my kitchen is remotely full,‚Äù she added. The struggle to secure basic necessities
                    has
                    become an exhausting routine for many families.</p>

                <p>Venezuela has suffered frequent shortages of basic foodstuffs in recent years, as government price
                    controls have made it unprofitable to produce them. Recurrent presidential decrees immediately
                    affect the country‚Äôs market‚Äîlike in August, when President Nicolas Maduro, a former union worker who
                    rose to power in 2013, announced new economic measures and stores started to fill up shelves with
                    pork meat, leaving chicken and beef nowhere to be found in Caracas for several weeks.
                    These measures often provide temporary relief but fail to address the root causes of the crisis.</p>

                <p>The economic crisis in this South American country, which has the world‚Äôs largest oil reserves, is
                    disrupting people‚Äôs lives in ways they‚Äôd never imagined. Poverty has almost doubled since 2015, and
                    Venezuelans lost, on average, 24 lbs due to food scarcity last year, according to a local university
                    study. An estimated 30 percent of children younger than 5 years old are malnourished, according to
                    the aid organization Caritas. The healthcare system is also overwhelmed, with hospitals lacking
                    essential medicines and equipment. Many families are forced to make impossible choices, such as
                    skipping meals to ensure their children can eat. The crisis has also led to a massive migration
                    wave, as millions of Venezuelans seek better opportunities abroad. Despite these hardships, many
                    Venezuelans continue to show resilience in their daily lives.</p>

                <p>Let me introduce myself: My name is Zozor. I was born on 23 November 2005.</p>

                <p>A bit meager, is it not? This is why I've now decided to write my biography to let my
                    readers know who I really am. I want to share the story of my experiences, struggles,
                    and the lessons I've learned along the way.</p>
