                <p>Getting food to your fridge is a full-time job in Venezuela,” she told me, wiping sweat from her forehead. It was 9:30 a.m., and already she had been standing under the blazing September sun for three hours. She said she often spends three full days a week waiting in line to buy basic products. “And it’s not like my kitchen is remotely full,” she added.</p>

                <p>Venezuela has suffered frequent shortages of basic foodstuffs in recent years, as government price controls have made it unprofitable to produce them. Recurrent presidential decrees immediately affect the country’s market—like in August, when President Nicolas Maduro, a former union worker who rose to power in 2013, announced new economic measures and stores started to fill up shelves with pork meat, leaving chicken and beef nowhere to be found in Caracas for several weeks.</p>

                <p>The economic crisis in this South American country, which has the world’s largest oil reserves, is disrupting people’s lives in ways they’d never imagined. Poverty has almost doubled since 2015, and Venezuelans lost, on average, 24 lbs due to food scarcity last year, according to a local university study. An estimated 30 percent of children younger than 5 years old are malnourished, according to the aid organization Caritas.</p>
